PathFinding.js
==============
#### A comprehensive path-finding library in javascript. ####

Introduction
------------

The aim of this project is to provide a path-finding library that can be easily incorporated into web games. It may run on Node.js or the browser.

It comes along with an [online demo](http://qiao.github.com/PathFinding.js/visual) to show how the algorithms execute. (The animation speed is deliberately slowed down for you to see the expanding procedure)

Server
------

If you want to use it in Node.js, you may install it via `npm`.

```bash
npm install pathfinding
```

Then, in your program:

```javascript
var PF = require('pathfinding');
```

Now skip to the `Basic Usage` section of this readme.


Browser
-------

Download the [minified js file](http://qiao.github.com/PathFinding.js/lib/pathfinding-browser.js) and include it in your web page.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="./pathfinding-browser.js"></script>
```

Basic Usage
-----------

To build a grid-map of width 5 and height 3:

```javascript
var grid = new PF.Grid(5, 3); 
```

By default, all the nodes in the grid will be able to be walked through.
To set whether a node at a given coordinate is walkable or not, use the `setWalkableAt` method.

For example, to set the node at (0, 1) to be un-walkable, where 0 is the x coordinate (from left to right), and 
1 is the y coordinate (from up to down):

```javascript
grid.setWalkableAt(0, 1, false);
```

You may also pass in a matrix while instantiating the `PF.Grid` class.
It will initiate all the nodes in the grid with the same walkability indicated by the matrix.
0 for walkable while 1 for blocked.

```javascript
var matrix = [
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
];
var grid = new PF.Grid(5, 3, matrix);
```

Currently there are eight path-finders bundled in this library, namely:

*  `AStarFinder` *
*  `BreadthFirstFinder` *
*  `BestFirstFinder`
*  `DijkstraFinder` *
*  `BiAStarFinder`
*  `BiBestFirstFinder`
*  `BiDijkstraFinder` *
*  `BiBreadthFirstFinder` *
*  `JumpPointFinder` *

The suffix `Bi` for the last four finders in the above list stands for the bi-directional searching strategy. 

Also, Note that only the finders with trailing asterisks are guaranteed to find the shortest path.

To build a path-finder, say, the `AStarFinder`:

```javascript
var finder = new PF.AStarFinder();
```

To find a path from (1, 2) to (4, 2), (Note: both the start point and end point should be walkable):

```javascript
var path = finder.findPath(1, 2, 4, 2, grid);
```

`path` will be an array of coordinates including both the start and end positions.

For the `matrix` defined previously, the `path` will be:

```javascript
[ [ 1, 2 ], [ 1, 1 ], [ 2, 1 ], [ 3, 1 ], [ 3, 2 ], [ 4, 2 ] ]
```

Be aware that `grid` will be modified in each path-finding, and will not be usable afterwards. If you want to use a single grid multiple times, create a clone for it before calling `findPath`.

```javascript
var gridBackup = grid.clone();
```


Advanced Usage
--------------

When instantiating path-finders, you may pass in additional parameters to indicate which specific strategies to use.

For all path-finders, you may indicate whether diagonal movement is allowed. The default value is `false`, which means that the path can only go orthogonally.

In order to enable diagonal movement:

```javascript
var finder = new PF.AStarFinder({
    allowDiagonal: true
});
```

For `AStarFinder`, `BestFirstFinder` and all their `Bi` relatives, you may indicate which heuristic function to use.

The predefined heuristics are `PF.Heuristic.manhattan`(defalut), `PF.Heuristic.chebyshev` and `PF.Heuristic.euclidean`.

To use the chebyshev heuristic:

```javascript
var finder = new PF.AStarFinder({
    heuristic: PF.Heuristic.chebyshev
});
```

To build a `BestFirstFinder` with diagonal movement allowed and a custom heuristic function:

```javascript
var finder = new PF.BestFirstFinder({
    allowDiagonal: true,
    heuristic: function(dx, dy) {
        return Math.min(dx, dy);
    }
});
```

Developing
----------

Layout:

    .
    |-- lib        # browser distribution
    |-- src        # source code (algorithms only)
    |-- test       # test scripts
    |-- utils      # build scripts
    `-- visual     # visualization
    `

You will need to install `node.js` and use `npm` to install the dependencies: 

    npm install -d 

To build the browser distribution  

    make

(It will use [node-browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to generate a browser distribution,
and use [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) to compress):

To run the tests (algorithm only, not including the visualization)

    make tests

(Tests are using [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) and [should.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js) )
