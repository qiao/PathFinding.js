PathFinding.js
==============
#### A comprehensive path-finding library in javascript. ####

Introduction
------------

The aim of this project is to provide a path-finding library that can be easily incorporated into web games. It may run on Node.js or the browser.

It comes along with an [online demo](http://qiao.github.com/PathFinding.js/visual) to show how the algorithms execute. (The pathfinding speed is slowed down in the demo)

Server
------

If you want to use it in Node.js, you may install it via `npm`.

```bash
npm install pathfinding
```

Then, in your program:

```javascript
var PF = require('pathfinding');
```

Now skip to the `Basic Usage` section of this readme.


Browser
-------

Download the [minified js file](http://qiao.github.com/PathFinding.js/lib/pathfinding-browser.min.js) and include it in your web page.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="./pathfinding-browser.min.js"></script>
```

Basic Usage
-----------

To build a grid-map of width 5 and height 3:

```javascript
var grid = new PF.Grid(5, 3); 
```

By default, all the nodes in the grid will be able to be walked through.
To set whether a node at a given coordinate is walkable or not, use the `setWalkableAt` method.

For example, to set the node at (0, 1) to be un-walkable, where 0 is the x coordinate (from left to right), and 
1 is the y coordinate (from up to down):

```javascript
grid.setWalkableAt(0, 1, false);
```

You may also pass in a matrix while instantiating the `PF.Grid` class.
It will initiate all the nodes in the grid with the same walkability indicated by the matrix.
0 for walkable while 1 for blocked.

```javascript
var matrix = [
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
];
var grid = new PF.Grid(5, 3, matrix);
```

Currently there are 9 path-finders bundled in this library, namely:

*  `AStarFinder` *
*  `BreadthFirstFinder` *
*  `BestFirstFinder`
*  `DijkstraFinder` *
*  `BiAStarFinder`
*  `BiBestFirstFinder`
*  `BiDijkstraFinder` *
*  `BiBreadthFirstFinder` *
*  `JumpPointFinder` *

The suffix `Bi` for the last four finders in the above list stands for the bi-directional searching strategy. 

Also, Note that only the finders with trailing asterisks are guaranteed to find the shortest path.

To build a path-finder, say, the `AStarFinder`:

```javascript
var finder = new PF.AStarFinder();
```

To find a path from (1, 2) to (4, 2), (Note: both the start point and end point should be walkable):

```javascript
var path = finder.findPath(1, 2, 4, 2, grid);
```

`path` will be an array of coordinates including both the start and end positions.

For the `matrix` defined previously, the `path` will be:

```javascript
[ [ 1, 2 ], [ 1, 1 ], [ 2, 1 ], [ 3, 1 ], [ 3, 2 ], [ 4, 2 ] ]
```

Be aware that `grid` will be modified in each path-finding, and will not be usable afterwards. If you want to use a single grid multiple times, create a clone for it before calling `findPath`.

```javascript
var gridBackup = grid.clone();
```


Advanced Usage
--------------

When instantiating path-finders, you may pass in additional parameters to indicate which specific strategies to use.

For all path-finders, you may indicate whether diagonal movement is allowed. The default value is `false`, which means that the path can only go orthogonally.

In order to enable diagonal movement:

```javascript
var finder = new PF.AStarFinder({
    allowDiagonal: true
});
```

When diagonal movement is enabled, you might want to prevent the path from touching the corners of the occupied grid blocks. This is usually desirable if the objects using the path have physical width and can also move between the grid cells.

To enable the corner crossing prevention:

```javascript
var finder = new PF.AStarFinder({
    allowDiagonal: true,
    dontCrossCorners: true
});
```

Note that `dontCrossCorners` only makes sense when `allowDiagonal` is also used. Currently all algorithms except `JumpPointFinder` support this feature.

For `AStarFinder`, `BestFirstFinder` and all their `Bi` relatives, you may indicate which heuristic function to use.

The predefined heuristics are `PF.Heuristic.manhattan`(defalut), `PF.Heuristic.chebyshev` and `PF.Heuristic.euclidean`.

To use the chebyshev heuristic:

```javascript
var finder = new PF.AStarFinder({
    heuristic: PF.Heuristic.chebyshev
});
```

To build a `BestFirstFinder` with diagonal movement allowed and a custom heuristic function:

```javascript
var finder = new PF.BestFirstFinder({
    allowDiagonal: true,
    heuristic: function(dx, dy) {
        return Math.min(dx, dy);
    }
});
```

To smoothen the path, you may use `PF.Util.smoothenPath`. This routine will return
a new path with the original one unmodified.

```javascript
var newPath = PF.Util.smoothenPath(grid, path);
```

Note that the new path will be compressed as well, i.e. if the original path is
`[[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4]]`, then the new path will be `[[0, 1], [0, 4]]`.


Developement
------------

Layout:

    .
    |-- lib          # browser distribution
    |-- src          # source code (algorithms only)
    |-- test         # test scripts
    |-- utils        # build scripts
    `-- visual       # visualization

You will need to install `node.js` and use `npm` to install the dependencies: 

    npm install -d 

To build the browser distribution 
(It will use [node-browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to generate a browser distribution,
and use [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) to compress):

    make

To run the tests
(algorithms only, not including the visualization) with
[mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) and [should.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js) 

    make test
